Setps to remember

1. Create the tree structure kind of data with array of objects.
2. when mapping this json data you need use recursive function
3. first render normally like how you do and then use that and
   create a another component and pass the list to it and render this
   component again inside it based on if the children is a array.kind of a recurisve way.
4. add a + and - before each folder and use toggle for this feature.
5. one problem here is when you click on + all the folders will expand so to solve this
6. instead of toggle use object("public":true).
7. now add a folder icon next to the folder name and create the functionality for adding folder based on id.
8. addListToNode in this function we need to update the main data for that check if the parentId with the main data id if its equal create an object and if there is children(other case) then call recursvely the same function for that check if children is present and at last return the node
9. deleteNodeFromList basically filter and map for map condition its again check for children and call recursvely and the same function and finally return node.
