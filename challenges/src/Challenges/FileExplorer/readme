Setps to remember

1. Create the tree structure kind of data with array of objects.
2. when mapping this json data you need use recursive function
3. first render normally like how you do and then use that and
   create a another component and pass the list to it and render this
   component again inside it based on if the children is a array.kind of a recurisve way.
4. add a + and - before each folder and use toggle for this feature.
5. one problem here is when you click on + all the folders will expand so to solve this
6. instead of toggle use object("public":true).
7. now add a folder icon next to the folder name and create the functionality for adding folder based on id.
8.
